## Setup
All you have to do is to run in your terminal(while being in the project root folder) `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`.
Also can use `docker-compose up -d` to run in detached mode (without live logs).

_Note_ : configure your server settings in `src/app/model.php` in `$connection` variable.
